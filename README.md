# Analyze-AB-Test-Results
This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.

# Overview:
For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. MY goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Steps included handling mismatched condition and page assignment, removing duplicate ids, hypothesis testing via bootstrapping and standard statistical tests, and multiple regression modelling.

# Statistical Analysis
1. Bootstrapping sampling distributions and p-value calculations
2. Z-core tests
3. Logistic regression
4. Multiple linear regression modelling to assess for interactions of independent variables

# Technologies Used
1. Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, StatsModels, Scipy
2. LaTex
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Key Findings
5. The conversion rate for the new page was not superior to that for the old page
6. The country of the user did not impact the rate of conversion between the new and old page
